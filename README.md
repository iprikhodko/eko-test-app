## Eko test app

This is Eko Corporation Co test task.
In the bounds of task were implemented Delivery Cost Calculator which allows to calculate delivery cost of provided route.
I only focused on calculator's implementation and not on adding new items to dictionaries like points and routes,
but you can do it manually by editing of [src/mock.json](src/mock.json) if it is required.

You can:
1. Add new points
2. Insert new points between two existing points
3. Remove points
4. Check delivery cost between two points
5. Check delivery cost for entire route

### To check task run the next command
```
clone repo to your computer
cd eko-test-app
npm install
npm start
go to localhost:3000


to run test
npm test
```
